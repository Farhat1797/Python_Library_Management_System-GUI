# Python Library Management System 
The Python Library Management System is a comprehensive desktop application designed to automate and simplify the tasks associated with managing a library. This system allows librarians and library staff to efficiently handle tasks such as book cataloging, user management, borrowing and returning books, and generating reports. Built using Python and a graphical user interface (GUI) library, this project offers a user-friendly experience for both librarians and library patrons.

Technologies Used:
Tkinter:

Tkinter is utilized as the primary GUI toolkit for creating the graphical interface.
SQLite (or other Database):

SQLite is often used as an embedded database to store and manage the library's data persistently. Alternatively, more robust databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL can be integrated.
Python:

Python serves as the core programming language for developing the application logic and handling data.
Key Features:
# Book Cataloging:

Efficiently catalog books by entering details such as title, author, genre, ISBN, publication date, and copies available. Support for adding new books and updating existing entries.

# User Management:

Manage library patrons by creating user accounts. Capture details like name, contact information, and membership status. Allow librarians to add, edit, and delete user accounts.

# Book Availability Status:

Display real-time information about the availability of books. Users can check whether a book is available for borrowing or currently checked out.

# Search and Filter:

Implement a robust search and filter system to help users quickly locate books based on criteria such as title, author, genre, or ISB
